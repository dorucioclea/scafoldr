# My Node Express Project

A simple RESTful API built with Node.js and Express, designed to serve as the backend for your application. This project demonstrates a clean architecture with generated models, repositories, services, controllers, and routes.

## Features
- **Models**: Sequelize models generated from your database schema
- **Repositories**: Data access layer with base repository pattern
- **Services**: Business logic layer built on top of repositories 
- **Controllers**: HTTP request handlers mapping to service methods
- **Routes**: Express routes wired to controllers
- **Configuration**: Environment variables and database settings

## Getting Started
1. Copy .env.example to .env and fill in your database URL and other settings.
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
3. Start the server:
```bash
npm run start
```
4. Access the API at http://localhost:3000/api
