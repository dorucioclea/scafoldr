## Running the Frontend

To run the frontend, ensure that the Python API is running first. Follow the steps in the "Running api" section above to start the backend.

### Steps to run the frontend:

1. Navigate to the `web` directory:
  ```bash
  cd web
  ```

2. Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

3. Start the development server:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

4. Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to access the frontend.

Make sure the backend API is running at http://localhost:8000, as the frontend relies on it for data and functionality.
